### Lab Grading

67% of the grade will be given when technical tasks are completed and clearly documented; 33% will be given for clear documentation. 

Note that for technical tasks, many labs are graded on a curve, such that students that put in more effort or have more significant results score higher, even if all tasks are completed. 

We typically receive most questions regarding the documentation. Here are some guidelines:

* *Clear formatting* - Organize your writing to ease the job of the reader (the simplest solution may be to just follow the structure in the lab description). Keep seperate sections clearly labeled. 
* *Write concisely* - Text for an online audience must be kept brief and concise: 1) motivate your problem, 2) explain your reasoning and solution, 3) discuss your results. Avoid repetition, and overly verbose writing; consider replacing long-winded text with clearly labeled images or videos. 
* *Follow guidelines for technical submissions* - Carefully describe all relevant aspects of your experimental setup, and label all axes on graphs. List any sources of noise, and discuss discrepancies.
* *Keep websites light* - that means use appropriate resolution for photos and embedded videos such that they load quickly. 
* *Always credit sources* - If you have worked with anyone, or have taken inspiration from other students or sources, be sure to credit them properly. 


### Slip days

All students will be allowed two one-week extensions, which can be applied to any lab. Details to follow.
