[Return to main page](index.md)

While there are no longer pandemic pre-cautions in place, please apply common sense if you or those around are symptomatic. If you have a health-related problem that interferes with class participation or deadlines, please reach out to the teaching team ASAP.

**Lectures** will take place in Bard Hall 140 and be broadcast over Zoom. Unless agreed upon otherwise with the instructors, all students are expected to attend lectures in person. To accommodate symptomatic or quaranteening students, lectures will also be recorded and posted on Canvas. 

**Lab sections** are mandatory. However, if you do not feel safe working in the lab, please reach out to your teaching team so that we can make accommodations. These may for example involve extending or dropping deadlines, or enabling you to carry out labs from home.
