# ECE 4160/5160, MAE 4910/5910: Fast Robots

## Cornell University, Spring 2023

This course focuses on systems level design and implementation of dynamic autonomous robots. We will design a fast autonomous car and explore dynamic behaviors, acting forces, sensors, and reactive control on an embedded processor, as well as the benefit of partial off-board computation, low latency software, and noise tolerant implementation.

Instead of traditional hand-ins, we leverage peer-to-peer mentoring where students, under guidance, upload their progress and ideas to create a sustainable and continuously evolving database for future students to rely on.
