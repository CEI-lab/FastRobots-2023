Kirstin is an assistant professor at Cornell in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, with field memberships in CS, MAE, and SYSEN. She regularly teaches Fast Robots and [ECE 6680 Multi-Agent Systems](https://cei.ece.cornell.edu/teaching-2/teaching/). When she is not teaching she runs the [Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab](https://cei.ece.cornell.edu/), which covers research on design and coordination of large robot collectives able to achieve complex behaviors beyond the reach of single robot systems, and corresponding studies on how social insects do so in nature. Before Cornell, Kirstin did a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Germany, and a doctorate in Computer Science at Harvard University. In her spare time, Kirstin loves to hang out with her sons, kayak, and build more robots.  

### Jonathan Jaramillo

Jonathan is an ECE graduate student working in the Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab under Kirstin Petersen. Having grown up near Ithaca, his research is focused on developing computer vision systems to help improve vineyard management techniques for grape growers here in the Finger Lakes region, and around the world. When heâ€™s not in the vineyard collecting data or testing a new computer vision system, he can often be found in the lab tinkering with robots or developing CV systems for studying social insect behavior.  Jonathan received a Bachelor of Science in physics and computer science from Houghton College and spent some time working as a systems engineer for Lockheed Martin.  

### Alex Coy

Alex Coy is an ECE graduate student in Prof Molnar's lab with a focus on analog and embedded design. Outside of academics, he enjoys cooking, making music, and audiovisual production. Some of his favorite achievements have been being the unofficial "Barbecue Dad" for the Big Red Marching Band and baking Chicago-style deep dish pizzas that disappear within two minutes of being near college students.
